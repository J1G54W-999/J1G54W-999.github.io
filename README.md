## Coding my portfolio page

### TL;DR

Keep reading if you're curious about the back-end stuff. 

I originally used Jekyll hacker theme and did my portfolio page all in markdown, but I wanted more control over how it looked and also more functionality. So I converted to HTML and I am doing all of the styling myself via an external CSS stylesheet. I am keeping the hacker theme look and feel and I will slowly add more info, CSS and also some JavaScript so it's not boring.

I'll keep this portfolio as updated as I can and if I have accomplished something new (e.g. an event, certification or new skill), it will be added to my webpage.
