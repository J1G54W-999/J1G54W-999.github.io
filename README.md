# Welcome to my portfolio!

# Whoami:
My name is Shae Haseldine and I am a passionate learner diving deep into the cybersecurity world! I began this journey after completing a 6-month bootcamp and have since been refining my technical skills to become a great Purple-Team asset. I am a critical thinker and like to solve puzzles and the cyber industry lets me do just that. I get to learn about computer systems, security exploits and how things work (what's under the hood).
